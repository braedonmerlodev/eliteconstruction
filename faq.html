			<h4 class="main-title">FAQ's</h4>
		<h4 class="privacy">With over 20+ years of experience, we have experienced just about every question possible. </h4> <h4 class="privacy"> Here are a few of them below:</h4>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_1" class="question">When can you begin the project?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_2" class="question">How do you appraise the cost of my project?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_3" class="question">How does payment work?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_4" class="question">Can you tell me more about your crew?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_5" class="question">What exactly is the process for a remodel project?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_6" class="question">How do I obtain the materials for my project?</a>
		<a href="#sectiontitle_8" class="question">Looking for more information?</a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_1" class="privacy">When can you begin the project? </h4>
		<a>We are ready to go, now! I have assembled my crew of guys over the last few years and we are prepared to get to work as soon as you and I agree on the details of your project. The first step is a signed contract, this is just to make sure that we are both committed to the project ahead of us. Once we get that finished, you just get to enjoy the process with your feet raised and a drink in hand. I'm looking forward to show you our quality of work. </a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_2" class="privacy">How do you appraise the cost of my project? </h4>
		<a> We always try to make sure that there is no transparency in the cost of your remodel. After we meet, this could take a few times and agree to the terms of your project. We will create a plan and outline every detail about how much each piece will cost. Making sure you reach out to us often when it comes to budget will allow for us to manage everything appropriately for you and your family. Understanding your goals is the most important step in building the remodel of your dreams.  </a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_3" class="privacy">How does payment work?</h4>
		<a>We will have you make payments during different parts of your project. The payment schedule will be displayed in the contract and can be modified if need be. We will manage your payment schedule depending on the dates you choose, but we get things come up. So, just give us a call if anything comes up. </a>

		<a>We do deal with clients who use equity/line of credit or pay by check. We also offer advice if you are looking to possibly finance your project. Our goal here is to help you achieve your new remodel with little to no stress. </a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_4" class="privacy">Can you tell me more about your crew? </h4>
			<a> My team has been assembled over the last 20+ years in which i've worked with many people and only recruited the best guys. I promise to take responsiblity for each job, no matter the size. Your standards should be high and so are ours. You should also know that my crew of guys are all fully insured and Elite Construction Company is fully licensed. We do this for both of our protection. </a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_5" class="privacy">What exactly is the process for a remodel project? </h4>			
		<a>Over the last 20 plus years, I have a specific process that has been successful for me time in and time out. The main pieces are communication and the contract really are the missing pieces to the puzzle. Me getting to know you and the ideas you have goes a long way into developing exactly what you want and need. This way I can create a visual picture of your goals and bring those goals to life. After such, is the budget and contract piece. Then the final transformation begins. Me and the crew start doing what we do best. If there is every any thing that is changed while completing the project, we will update the contract and get back to work as soon as possible. We will be with you every step of the way. </a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_6" class="privacy">How do I obtain the materials for my project? </h4>
		<a> Depending on the project, we will purchase different supplies. For example, cabinents, fixtures, doors, flooring, etc. Over the last few decades I have worked with a list of companies that I believe will give you the best material while always being courteous of your budget. We are here to help you with everything! Just ask, and we'll make it work for you.</a>

		<h4 id="sectiontitle_8" class="privacy">Looking for more information?</h4>
		<a> We know you have many questions. Don't hesitate to reach out, we’re here to help!</a>
